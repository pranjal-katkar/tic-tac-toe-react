# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game – Built with React  

A simple yet interactive **Tic Tac Toe game** built using **React**. This project is part of my learning journey through **Maximilian Schwarzmüller’s Udemy course**. The game allows two players to take turns, detects the winner automatically, and provides an option for a rematch.

## 🌱 What I Learned  
- **Component-based architecture**: How to break down the application into reusable components like `GameBoard`, `Square`, and `GameOver`.
- **Props and state management**: Passing data between components and managing state for game logic (e.g., tracking player turns, determining the winner).
- **Conditional rendering**: Displaying different UI elements based on the state, such as the winner, draw message, or rematch button.
- **Event handling**: Handling user interactions, like clicks on the game grid, to trigger game logic.
- **Responsive design**: Ensuring the game works across different screen sizes using CSS and React's layout components.
- **React best practices**: Writing clean, maintainable React code, using hooks (like `useState`) for managing state, and keeping components small and focused.
